This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)

df1 <- read.csv('rpe.csv')
df2 <- read.csv('wellness.csv')

df1$SessionType = factor(df1$SessionType)

df2$PlayerID = factor(df2$PlayerID)
#df2$Fatigue = factor(df2$Fatigue)

df2$Date <- ymd(df2$Date)
df1$Date <- ymd(df1$Date)

```


```{r}
ggplot(df1, aes(x= df1$SessionType, y=df1$SessionLoad, fill=df1$SessionType)) +
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(df1, aes(x= df1$SessionType, y=df1$RPE, fill=df1$SessionType)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```


```{r}
dftemp = subset(df2, PlayerID == 1)
dfweight = subset(df1, SessionType == 'Game')

ggplot(dftemp, aes(x = dftemp$Date, y = dftemp$Fatigue, color = PlayerID)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = dfweight$Date, linetype = 3)

ggsave("Category_3 Frequency by Time.png", width = 25, height = 10)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
